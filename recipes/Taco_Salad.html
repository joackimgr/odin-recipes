    <p>This is a quick-to-throw-together taco salad that even picky family members will eat, as you can serve any of the ingredients on the side. I sometimes serve with taco shells and let my five-year-old make tacos out of the ingredients (minus the dressing for the salad). Serve salad with tortilla chips, avocado, cilantro, and Cheddar cheese to taste. Yum!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 head romaine lettuce, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) basket grape tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 avocado, pitted and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped carrots, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons champagne vinegar</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
